:description: A Game With Weight

== What is 9.81?

_9.81_ is a 2D action platformer developed at Northeastern University by
students of the GAME 3700 course. The core aim of the game was to have one
central combat mechanic, that being gravity manipulation. _9.81_ was created
developed in Unity using the Universal Render Pipeline.

== How do I run 9.81?

This repository contains the Unity project for the game, and therefore must
be run using the engine. If you'd like to run an external build, please see
